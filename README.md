# Quand La Vie C'est Pourri

[Quand La Vie C'est Pourri](https://www.viepourrie.com/) is a French web app that proposes activities when you're feeling down (or just
want ideas) based on your location and preferences for the day. It is optimized for mobile but is responsive on tablet and desktop. The
goal is to make your day better by helping you find something that will make your day better and put you in a better mood. It includes a
journal to follow your progress and track which activities you preferred. It is based on a [card game](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1147771650/when-life-is-rotten-card-game?show_sold_out_detail=1&ref=nla_listing_details) created by one of
the developers [McSquurl](https://github.com/mcsqurrl) with completely original illustrations.
